# RanSomeWhere
This is a simple ransomware created to satisfy FC421 Applied Cryptography course project

The code is originally forked and built on top of [this](https://github.com/bing0o/simple_ransomware.git) repo

# Future plans
- Exfilterate encrypted key 
- Encrypt part of files to utilize the use of resource 
- Overwrite the key with multiple values to avoid recovery using forensic tools
- Autorun (Add persistance)
- Optimization (reconstruct the code structure)
- More test and debugging :)
