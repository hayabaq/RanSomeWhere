# RanSomeWhere
This is a simple ransomware created to satisfy FC421 Applied Cryptography course project

The code is originally forked and built on top of [this](https://github.com/bing0o/simple_ransomware.git) repo

# Future plans
- Exfilterate encrypted key 
- overwrite the key with multiple values to avoid recovery using forensic tools
- autorun 
- more test and debugging :)
